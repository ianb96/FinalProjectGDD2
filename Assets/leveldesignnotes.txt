When I started to think of the level design for the 2.5D sidescroller beat-em-up game I was designing,
The only level design involved was how deep the level was, where minor obstacles like boxes would go, and where enemies where placed.
When looking at references, I realized that one of the major appeals of these types of games were the variety and quality of level background designs and the story told in them.
As I am not able to create detailed background environments each level I would have to use simple repetitive backgrounds or royalty free art. 
That did not leave much variety and would have resulted in generic levels.
While considering the combat mechanics, the depth of the level turned out to be irrelevent because 
there was not a way to attck enemies in front of or behind the player from the camera's point of view. 
That and the fact I decided to use 2D graphics for their simplicity, resulted in changing the game to be completely 2D.
So now, the player will not be able to change their depth.
However the levels felt even more bland and withour variety, so I decided to allow the player to be able to jump vertically.
This resulted in the entire game becomming a 2D action platformer.
2D platformers are very common, and the level design was more straightforward as well.
